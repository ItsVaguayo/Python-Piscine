# 🐍 Python Piscine

The **Python Piscine** is an intensive curriculum aimed at easing the transition from **low-level C programming** to **modern Python (3.10+)**.

Its main goal is to evolve from a primarily **procedural approach** to **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, applying **Pythonic best practices** and reinforcing **robust software architecture** principles.

## 📚 Modules

The Piscine is organized into **11 modules**, progressing from language fundamentals to more advanced concepts:

| Module | Topic | Focus |
|------:|-------|-------|
| 00 | Fundamentals | Shifting logic from C to Python: syntax, recursion, and types |
| 01 | OOP Basics | Classes, objects, and encapsulation |
| 02 | Robustness | Exception handling, custom errors, and fault-tolerant pipelines |
| 03 | Collections | Lists, dictionaries, sets, and generators for practical data workflows |
| 04 | Persistence | File I/O, context managers, and RAII-style resource handling |
| 05 | Polymorphism | Method overriding and flexible flow design |
| 06 | Package Management | Imports, circular dependencies, and `__init__.py` |
| 07 | Advanced OOP | Abstract Base Classes (ABC), interfaces, and multiple inheritance |
| 08 | Environments | Virtual environments, `pip`, and project configuration |
| 09 | Data Validation | Building reliable data models with **Pydantic** |
| 10 | Functional Programming | Decorators, lambdas, and higher-order functions |
